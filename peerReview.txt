For coding:

1)It might be helpful to comment more when you use the piping, since we didn't do that in class

2)Code was very well organized and it was clear what you were doing in every step

3)You used a lot of different parameters, which is a great idea for simulations because you can see a lot of different scenarios


For report:

1)Even though it looks like the population hits zero, it actually never reaches 0, be careful when saying that

2)When talking about conversion efficiency, maybe explain what that means more (i.e. if conversion efficiency is low the biomass of prey is not being converting into new predators)

3)Define more dramatic life cycle slope (more steep?)

4)Elaborate a little more about predator-prey dynamics in the question on the role of predators

5Adding graphs to your report would make it easier to visualize what you are saying with text, and shows that your code works


General comments:
-Your for loops show that you knew how to use the skills of the class to efficiently code what you need to do, good job!

-Code is easy to follow and well commented
